1. Customer Demographics Segmentation:
       This analysis helps you understand your customer base by basic demographic details 
       such as age, gender, and location.

Focus Area: Age, Gender, and Location
Reason: Understanding the demographics allows for targeted marketing campaigns and personalized product recommendations.



2. High-Value Customers (RFM Analysis):
      RFM analysis classifies customers based on Recency (last purchase), 
      Frequency (number of purchases), and Monetary value (total spending).

Focus Area: RFM Segmentation
Reason: This helps you identify the most valuable customers who are more likely to spend again and can be offered personalized discounts.



3. Dormant/Churned Customers:
       These customers haven’t made a purchase in a long time and may be at risk of churning.

Focus Area: Churned Customers
Reason: Reactivating these customers can significantly increase sales, 
        especially through targeted re-engagement campaigns.



4. Occasional Big Spenders:
These customers make fewer purchases but spend significantly when they do.

Focus Area: Big Spenders
Reason: Encouraging these customers to buy more frequently can 
        increase the overall sales of high-value products.




5. Frequent Shoppers with Low Spending:
These customers shop often but have low average order values.

Focus Area: Frequent Low-Spend Shoppers
Reason: Target these customers with higher-value product recommendations to 
        increase their average order value.



6. Geographical Segmentation:
Segment customers based on their location (city, state, etc.) to focus on region-specific marketing.

Focus Area: Location-Based Segmentation
Reason: Identifying regions with high-potential customers helps create localized
        marketing campaigns and drive regional sales growth.


7. Product Category Lovers:
Customers who frequently purchase from specific product categories.

Focus Area: Category-Based Segmentation
Reason: Understanding customer preferences for product categories helps in
        recommending relevant products and cross-selling within favorite categories



8. First-Time Buyers:
         Segmenting customers who have made only one purchase to target them with special offers and
         convert them into repeat buyers.

Focus Area: New Customers (First-Time Buyers)
Reason: Converting first-time buyers into loyal customers is key to building long-term revenue streams.









Here’s a structured approach to Customer Segmentation for an e-commerce platform like Myntra, using SQL to analyze customer demographics, purchase behavior, and other key areas. Each segment will include the SQL query to extract insights.

1. Customer Demographics Segmentation
This analysis helps you understand your customer base by basic demographic details such as age, gender, and location.

Focus Area: Age, Gender, and Location
Reason: Understanding the demographics allows for targeted marketing campaigns and personalized product recommendations.

SQL Code:
sql
Copy code
-- Segmenting customers by age, gender, and location
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.gender,
    c.age,
    c.city,
    COUNT(p.purchase_id) AS total_purchases,
    SUM(p.total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM 
    customer AS c
JOIN 
    purchase AS p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_id, c.gender, c.age, c.city
ORDER BY 
    total_spent DESC;
2. High-Value Customers (RFM Analysis)
RFM analysis classifies customers based on Recency (last purchase), Frequency (number of purchases), and Monetary value (total spending).

Focus Area: RFM Segmentation
Reason: This helps you identify the most valuable customers who are more likely to spend again and can be offered personalized discounts.

SQL Code:
sql
Copy code
-- Performing RFM segmentation
WITH RFM AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_id,
        MAX(p.purchase_date) AS last_purchase_date,
        COUNT(p.purchase_id) AS frequency,
        SUM(p.total_amount) AS monetary_value
    FROM 
        customer AS c
    JOIN 
        purchase AS p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
    GROUP BY 
        c.customer_id
)
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    DATEDIFF(DAY, last_purchase_date, GETDATE()) AS recency,
    frequency,
    monetary_value
FROM 
    RFM
ORDER BY 
    monetary_value DESC;
3. Dormant/Churned Customers
These customers haven’t made a purchase in a long time and may be at risk of churning.

Focus Area: Churned Customers
Reason: Reactivating these customers can significantly increase sales, especially through targeted re-engagement campaigns.

SQL Code:
sql
Copy code
-- Identifying customers who haven't purchased in the last 6 months
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    MAX(p.purchase_date) AS last_purchase_date,
    SUM(p.total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM 
    customer AS c
JOIN 
    purchase AS p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_id, c.name
HAVING 
    MAX(p.purchase_date) < DATEADD(MONTH, -6, GETDATE())
ORDER BY 
    last_purchase_date ASC;
4. Occasional Big Spenders
These customers make fewer purchases but spend significantly when they do.

Focus Area: Big Spenders
Reason: Encouraging these customers to buy more frequently can increase the overall sales of high-value products.

SQL Code:
sql
Copy code
-- Finding occasional big spenders
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    COUNT(p.purchase_id) AS total_purchases,
    AVG(p.total_amount) AS avg_order_value,
    SUM(p.total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM 
    customer AS c
JOIN 
    purchase AS p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_id, c.name
HAVING 
    COUNT(p.purchase_id) <= 5 -- Occasional shoppers
    AND SUM(p.total_amount) > 50000 -- High spenders
ORDER BY 
    total_spent DESC;
5. Frequent Shoppers with Low Spending
These customers shop often but have low average order values.

Focus Area: Frequent Low-Spend Shoppers
Reason: Target these customers with higher-value product recommendations to increase their average order value.

SQL Code:
sql
Copy code
-- Identifying frequent shoppers with low spending
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    COUNT(p.purchase_id) AS total_purchases,
    AVG(p.total_amount) AS avg_order_value
FROM 
    customer AS c
JOIN 
    purchase AS p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_id, c.name
HAVING 
    COUNT(p.purchase_id) > 10 -- Frequent shoppers
    AND AVG(p.total_amount) < 2000 -- Low average order value
ORDER BY 
    total_purchases DESC;
6. Geographical Segmentation
Segment customers based on their location (city, state, etc.) to focus on region-specific marketing.

Focus Area: Location-Based Segmentation
Reason: Identifying regions with high-potential customers helps create localized marketing campaigns and drive regional sales growth.

SQL Code:
sql
Copy code
-- Segmenting customers based on city and state
SELECT 
    c.city,
    COUNT(c.customer_id) AS total_customers,
    SUM(p.total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM 
    customer AS c
JOIN 
    purchase AS p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
GROUP BY 
    c.city
ORDER BY 
    total_spent DESC;
7. Product Category Lovers
Customers who frequently purchase from specific product categories.

Focus Area: Category-Based Segmentation
Reason: Understanding customer preferences for product categories helps in recommending relevant products and cross-selling within favorite categories.

SQL Code:
sql
Copy code
-- Identifying customers' favorite product categories
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    pr.category,
    COUNT(p.purchase_id) AS total_purchases,
    SUM(p.total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM 
    customer AS c
JOIN 
    purchase AS p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
JOIN 
    product AS pr ON p.product_id = pr.product_id
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_id, c.name, pr.category
ORDER BY 
    total_spent DESC;
8. First-Time Buyers
Segmenting customers who have made only one purchase to target them with special offers and convert them into repeat buyers.

Focus Area: New Customers (First-Time Buyers)
Reason: Converting first-time buyers into loyal customers is key to building long-term revenue streams.


Why These Segments?
These segments are designed to target different customer behaviors and stages of the buying journey, including:

High-Value Customers: Increase loyalty and repeat purchases.
Churned Customers: Reactivate and retain customers.
Big Spenders & Frequent Low Spenders: Increase sales through upselling and cross-selling.
Geographical & Product Segments: Focus on localization and product preferences for better targeting.
