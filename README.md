# Customer Segmentation and Sales Analysis Using SQL

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer data to derive actionable insights that can improve sales and customer retention. The analysis includes customer segmentation based on demographics, behavior, and geography, as well as identifying churned customers, big spenders, and frequent shoppers.

## Analysis Performed

### 1. Demographics Segmentation

- **Age Group**: Segmented customers by their age.
  - **Insight**: Customers aged 45 and above are frequent purchasers.

  - **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase.
  - **Frequency**: How often a customer purchases.
  - **Monetary Value**: The total amount spent by a customer.

  **Top 5 Customers by RFM Analysis**:
